adding flash and bootstrap
flash is added by npm installing

    req.flash("success", "Logout Successful!");

we added res.locals.message = req.flash("error") to the global scope so it can be reached throughout the entire project. 

In the header file, we also adding the message under the navbar so it can displat the error/success message

    <% if(error && error.length > 0){ %>
its because its an empty array
